{"line_index": 15, "text": "Scrub the skins of the sweet potatoes and halve the potatoes lengthwise. In a pot, cover them with plenty of salted water and bring to a boil, then simmer until tender, 15 to 25 minutes.", "label": "step"}
{"line_index": 16, "text": "Meanwhile, make the chermoula. In a food processor, blend the cilantro, parsley, chile, garlic, paprika, cumin, cayenne and 1 teaspoon salt with a tablespoon or two of the oil to make a rough paste. Gradually blend in the rest of the oil. Finally, stir in the lemon juice. Adjust the seasonings: The flavor should be bright and assertive, so add more lemon juice, salt or cayenne (judiciously) if it needs a kick. Smooth out with 1 to 2 tablespoons additional oil if the chermoula is too thick. Put the sauce in a small bowl.", "label": "step"}
{"line_index": 17, "text": "When the sweet potatoes are done, fish them from the water and let them steam themselves dry on a dish towel while you warm a few tablespoons of olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Working in batches, sear the cut sides of the sweet potatoes to caramelize them, 4 to 6 minutes (you may need more oil for the second batch). Spoon some of the chermoula over the top and serve the rest on the side, with roasted chickpeas if desired.", "label": "step"}
