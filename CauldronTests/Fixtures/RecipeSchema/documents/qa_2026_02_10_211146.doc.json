    "2 c. buttermilk",
    "1 tbsp. paprika",
    "1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper",
    "Kosher salt",
    "1 1/2 lb. boneless, skinless chicken cutlets",
    "4 oil-packed anchovies, very finely chopped",
    "1 garlic clove, grated",
    "1/2 c. mayonnaise",
    "2 tsp. Dijon mustard",
    "2 tsp. fresh lemon juice",
    "2 tsp. Worcestershire sauce",
    "2 oz. Parmesan, finely grated (about 1 cup), divided",
    "1/2 tsp. freshly ground black pepper",
    "3 c. (360 g.) all-purpose flour",
    "12 slider buns",
    "4 tbsp. unsalted butter, melted",
    "Vegetable oil, for frying (about 6 cups)",
    "1 head of romaine, core removed, leaves separated.",
    "Instructions",
    "In a large bowl, whisk buttermilk, paprika, cayenne, and 1 Tbsp. salt. Add chicken, turning to fully coat. Tightly cover bowl (or transfer to a large resealable bag, pressing out excess air, and seal).",
    "Refrigerate at least 2 hours and up to overnight.",
    "<div style=\"position: relative;\">In a medium bowl, combine anchovies, garlic, mayonnaise, mustard, lemon juice, Worcestershire, and 3/4 cup Parmesan; season with 1/2 tsp. salt and 1/2 tsp. pepper and stir until thickened. Refrigerate until ready to use.</div>",
    "Arrange a rack in center of oven; preheat to 375\u00b0. In a large bowl, whisk flour and 2 tsp. salt.",
    "Arrange bottoms of buns cut sides up and tops of buns cut sides down on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Brush with butter; top with remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan.",
    "Bake buns until golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer sheet to a wire rack.",
    "Working one piece at a time, remove chicken from brine. Place in flour dredge and thoroughly coat, pressing flour to adhere. Dredge in brine, then in flour again to have a double coating. Transfer to a baking sheet or plate.",
    "Into a large Dutch oven or heavy pot fitted with a deep-fry thermometer, pour oil to a depth of 3\". Heat over medium heat until thermometer registers 325\u00b0. Place a wire rack set in a baking sheet next to the stovetop; alternatively, line a baking sheet with paper towels.",
    "Fry chicken, adjusting heat as needed to maintain oil temperature between 300\u00b0 and 325\u00b0, until deeply golden and an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part registers 165\u00b0, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer to prepared rack.",
    "In a large bowl, toss romaine with 1/4 cup dressing. Spread remaining dressing across bottom buns. Add chicken, then top with romaine, keeping it as flat as possible for easier stacking. Close with top buns, gently press down, and secure each with a skewer (if desired)."
