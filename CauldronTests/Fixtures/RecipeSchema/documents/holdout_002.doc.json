    "Easy Chicken Pot Pie",
    "Ingredients",
    "5 tablespoons butter (70g)",
    "1 medium yellow onion, finely chopped",
    "2 medium carrots, finely chopped, about 1 cup chopped",
    "1 large rib celery, finely chopped",
    "2 garlic cloves, minced",
    "\u00bc cup plus 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour (40g)",
    "2 cups low-sodium chicken broth or homemade broth (470ml)",
    "1 cup whole milk (235ml)",
    "1 tablespoon chopped sage or 1 teaspoon dried sage",
    "1 cup frozen peas, no need to thaw (135g)",
    "4 cups shredded or diced cooked or rotisserie chicken, 1 pound shredded (450g)",
    "1 sheet store-bought puff pastry, thawed, see tips",
    "1 egg, beaten",
    "\u00bd teaspoon fresh ground black pepper",
    "Fine sea salt, to taste",
    "Instructions",
    "Prep: Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F (204\u00b0C). Set aside a large baking sheet.",
    "Cook veggies: In a 10-inch cast-iron skillet over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the onion, carrots, celery, and garlic. Cook, stirring in the skillet, until they soften and take on a little color, about 6 minutes.",
    "Make the gravy: Sprinkle the flour evenly over the vegetables, then stir to form a roux. Cook for 1 minute, then slowly pour in the chicken broth, stirring to prevent lumps. Then stir in the milk and bring to a simmer. Simmer until they thicken into a gravy.",
    "Finish the filling: Add the sage, peas, and shredded chicken. Season with the pepper and a good pinch of salt. Taste, then adjust with more salt and pepper as needed (we use 1 to 1 \u00bd teaspoons of salt, but it depends on the broth/stock). Cook until the filling is simmering, then remove from the heat and set aside to cool for 10 minutes while you prepare the pastry.",
    "Roll out the pastry: Lightly flour a workbench, then unfold the puff pastry. Roll out to a rectangle 11 inches long on both sides (store-bought sheets are usually rectangles, so one side will probably be longer).",
    "Add the pastry: Carefully lay the puff pastry over the skillet. Trim to an inch or so of the edge, then fold over the pastry to build up the sides. To achieve a thicker edge, cut the trimmed excess dough into strips and press them around the edges.Cut four 2-inch slits in the center of the pie to allow steam to escape, and then brush the top with the beaten egg.",
    "Bake: Place the baking sheet into the oven, and then place the skillet on top of it, so it catches any overflow. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes, turning the skillet once halfway through baking. Look for a nicely golden brown, puffed crust on top. If the pastry starts to get too dark, too early, tent with foil.",
    "Serve: Remove from the oven, then allow to rest for 15 minutes before serving."
