    "Perfectly Pillowy Cinnamon Rolls",
    "Ingredients",
    "1/2 cup (113g) milk, whole preferred",
    "3 tablespoons (24g) King Arthur Unbleached Bread Flour",
    "2/3 cup (151g) milk, cold, whole preferred",
    "2 1/2 cups (300g) King Arthur Unbleached Bread Flour",
    "1 teaspoon (6g) table salt",
    "2 tablespoons (25g) granulated sugar",
    "2 teaspoons instant yeast",
    "4 tablespoons (57g) unsalted butter, softened",
    "1 tablespoon (14g) butter, melted",
    "1/2 cup (107g) light brown sugar, packed",
    "2 tablespoons (14g) King Arthur Unbleached Bread Flour",
    "3 to 4 teaspoons (8g to 10g) cinnamon*",
    "1/16 teaspoon table salt",
    "3 tablespoons (42g) butter, melted, divided",
    "1/2 teaspoon King Arthur Pure Vanilla Extract",
    "1 1/2 cups (170g) confectioners' sugar, sifted",
    "1 to 2 tablespoons (14g to 28g) milk, heavy cream, or buttermilk, enough to thin to desired consistency",
    "Instructions",
    "To make the tangzhong: Combine both the ingredients in a small saucepan, and whisk until no lumps remain.",
    "Place the saucepan over medium heat and cook the mixture, stirring regularly, until thickened, paste-like, and the spoon or spatula leaves lines on the bottom of the pan. This should take 1 to 3 minutes, depending on the strength of your burner.",
    "Remove from the heat and transfer to a large mixing bowl, the bowl of a stand mixer, or the bucket of a bread machine (whatever you plan to knead the dough in).",
    "To make the dough: Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess. Add the cold milk, then the flour and remaining ingredients to the mixing bowl in the order listed; the heat from the tangzhong will help to warm the cold milk.",
    "Mix \u2014 by hand, on low speed of a stand mixer with the dough hook attachment, or in a bread machine set to the dough cycle \u2014 to bring the dough together. Next, knead the dough until it\u2019s smooth, elastic, and tacky. This will take up to 15 minutes by hand, 10 to 12 minutes on medium-low speed of a mixer, or the length of the dough cycle in a bread machine.",
    "Shape the dough into a ball, place it in a bowl, and cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a reusable cover.",
    "Let the dough rise until puffy but not necessarily doubled in bulk, about 60 to 90 minutes (depending on the warmth of your kitchen).",
    "To make the filling: While the dough is rising, put the melted butter into a medium bowl and add the remaining ingredients, stirring until the mixture is the texture of damp sand. Set aside.",
    "Lightly grease a baking sheet, or line it with parchment paper.",
    "To assemble the cinnamon rolls: Transfer the dough to a lightly greased work surface and press it into a 10\u201d x 12\u201d rectangle that\u2019s about 1/2\u201d thick. For evenly shaped cinnamon rolls, try to pat the dough into an actual rectangle (with corners), rather than an oval.",
    "Sprinkle the filling over the dough, covering all but a 1/2\u201d strip along one long side.",
    "Starting with the filling-covered long side, roll the dough into a log.",
    "Score the dough lightly into eight equal 1 1/2\u201d to 2\u201d pieces; this will make large, saucer-sized cinnamon rolls \u2014 their generous size is part of their charm. Cut the dough at the score marks. Dental floss will give you the cleanest cut: pull off a long piece of floss, loop it underneath the log at the score mark, and pull the ends in opposite directions to cut the dough. Repeat until you've cut all of the cinnamon rolls. If you don\u2019t have dental floss, a bench knife or sharp knife will work.",
    "Place the cinnamon rolls onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them so there\u2019s at least 2\u201d between each one and they\u2019re 2\u201d away from the edges of the pan; a 3-2-3 arrangement works well. To prevent them from unraveling while they rise and bake, tuck the ends of the spirals underneath the cinnamon rolls so that they\u2019re held in place.",
    "Cover the cinnamon rolls with lightly greased plastic wrap or a reusable cover and let them rise for 30 to 60 minutes (depending on the warmth of your kitchen). The cinnamon rolls should be puffy and the dough shouldn\u2019t bounce back immediately when gently pressed.",
    "About 20 minutes before you\u2019re ready to bake, position a rack in the top third of the oven. Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F.",
    "Bake the cinnamon rolls for 14 to 18 minutes, until they\u2019re a light golden brown and a digital thermometer inserted into the center of one roll reads 190\u00b0F. Bake for the lesser amount of time for extra-soft cinnamon rolls, and the longer amount of time for cinnamon rolls with a bit more color and slightly firmer texture.",
    "Remove the cinnamon rolls from the oven, place the pan on a rack, and brush the hot cinnamon rolls with 1 1/2 tablespoons (21g) of the melted butter. Let the cinnamon rolls cool for 10 to 15 minutes before icing.",
    "To make the icing: Combine the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons (21g) melted butter with the remaining icing ingredients in a medium bowl, mixing with a spatula until smooth. Milk makes a lovely frosting; using cream in place of milk creates an extra layer of richness, while substituting buttermilk adds subtle tang, a nice counterpoint to the icing's overall sweetness.",
    "Ice the cinnamon rolls and serve immediately. If you\u2019re planning to serve the cinnamon rolls later, wait to ice them until just before serving. Store icing at room temperature, tightly covered, until you\u2019re ready to use it.",
    "Store completely cooled cinnamon rolls, un-iced and well wrapped, for a couple of days at room temperature; or freeze for up to 1 month."
