    "Kale, Apple and Goat Cheese Salad with Granola Croutons",
    "Ingredients",
    "1 cup old-fashioned oats",
    "\u00bd cup roughly chopped pecans",
    "\u00bd cup raw pepitas (hulled pumpkin seeds)",
    "\u00bd cup raw sunflower seeds",
    "\u00bc teaspoon fine sea salt",
    "\u00bc teaspoon ground cinnamon",
    "Pinch of cayenne pepper",
    "1 large egg white, beaten",
    "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil",
    "1 tablespoon maple syrup or honey",
    "1 tablespoon lemon juice",
    "1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon smooth Dijon mustard",
    "Hefty pinch of fine sea salt",
    "Freshly ground black pepper, to taste",
    "1 large bunch or 2 small bunches (12 ounces) curly green kale",
    "1 medium Honeycrisp, Granny Smith or Fuji apple",
    "2 ounces chilled goat cheese, crumbled (about \u00bd cup)",
    "\u00bc cup chopped dried cranberries",
    "Instructions",
    "To make the granola: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and line a large, rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper for easy clean-up. In a medium bowl, stir together the oats, pecans, pepitas, sunflower seeds, salt, cinnamon and cayenne pepper. Stir in the beaten egg white, oil, and maple syrup until well blended. Transfer the mixture to the prepared baking sheet and bake until golden, gently stirring the granola halfway, about 15 to 17 minutes. Let the granola cool on the baking sheet.",
    "To make the dressing: In a small bowl, combine the olive oil, lemon juice, mustard, maple syrup and salt. Season with a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper and whisk until blended. The dressing should be zippy, but if it\u2019s overwhelmingly tart, stir in another teaspoon of sweetener. Or, if it needs some extra oomph, stir in another pinch of salt.",
    "To prepare the kale, use a chef\u2019s knife to remove the tough ribs from the kale, then discard the ribs (or feed them to your dog!). Chop the kale leaves into small, bite-sized pieces. Transfer the chopped kale to a big salad bowl. Sprinkle a small pinch of sea salt over the kale and massage the leaves with your hands by lightly scrunching big handfuls at a time, until the leaves are darker in color and fragrant.",
    "To assemble the salad, drizzle all of the dressing over the kale and toss well. Add the chopped apple, crumbled goat cheese, cranberries, and about half of the granola. Gently toss to combine, and serve. This salad will keep well, covered and refrigerated, for up to 4 days.",
    "Save the leftover granola for a snack or another salad. Store it in an air-tight bag with the air squeezed out for up to 2 weeks at room temperature, or several months in the freezer."
